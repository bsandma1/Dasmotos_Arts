# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

Aside from completing Freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design course 5-6 months ago, this is the first web development project I have worked on!  

The project is a very basic webpage that uses HTML and CSS.

Included is the HTML file, the CSS file, the images used in the webpage, and the project outline that was used for reference.

- HTML file - index.html
- CSS file - index.css
- Image files - located in the images directory
- Outline file - located in the outline directory
